/*Task 2
Create a program that prints out a multiplication table that will be specified by the user:

Ask user what multiplication table they would like to see.
They should be able to input a number via the keyboard.
The system should then output the appropriate times table (from 1X to 10X).
For example, if the user entered 3 then the system should display the following: ​
1 x 3 = 3 ​
2 x 3 = 6
3 x 3 = 9 ​
4 x 3 = 12 ​
….​
10 x 3 = 30
